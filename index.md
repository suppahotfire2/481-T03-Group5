## Summary of Genealogy Mobile App

We're creating a project to keep track of an animals genealogy. Our target audience is targeted towards animal breeders. The application provides a visual overview of the animal's family tree. Also helps animal breeders discover other breeders to contact. Since their isn't a platform that is helpful. We thought it would be helpful in creating an App to assist in making it easier for animal breeders.
